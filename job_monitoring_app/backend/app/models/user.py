        User model

        Attributes:
        -----------
        id : int
            The primary key of the user
        email : str
            The email of the user
        hashed_password : str
            The hashed password of the user
        first_name : str
            The first name of the user
        last_name : str
            The last name of the user

        role : str
            The role of the user (provider, hospital, admin)
        api_keys : relationship
            The api keys associated with the user (one to many)
        studies : relationship
            The studies associated with the user (one to many)
        provider_studies : relationship
            The provider studies associated with the user (one to many)
        study_configurations : relationship
            The study configurations associated with the user (one to many)
        Note:
    Provider has many study configurations:
        This indicates that a single User instance, when acting as a Provider,
         can be associated with multiple StudyConfiguration instances.
         This is a one-to-many relationship from the Provider's perspective.
    Bidirectional:
        This means that the relationship is set up in such a way that it can be navigated in both directions.
        From a StudyConfiguration instance, you can access the associated Provider (User), and from a Provider (User),
        you can access all associated StudyConfigurations.
    Child class -> StudyConfiguration:
        This indicates that StudyConfiguration is the child class in this relationship.
        In other words, StudyConfiguration instances are the ones being "owned" or referenced by the Provider (User).
    Parent class -> Provider:
        This indicates that User (referred to as Provider in this context) is the parent class in this relationship.
        In other words, a Provider can "own" or reference multiple StudyConfiguration instances.
    Parent-child relationship (has many to one) -> provider_study_configurations:
    This is another way of saying that a Provider can have many StudyConfigurations.
    The provider_study_configurations seems to be the name given to this relationship,
     but it's not directly visible in the provided code.
    Child-parent relationship (one to many) -> provider (see study_configuration.py):
    This is referring to the ability of a StudyConfiguration instance to reference its associated Provider (User).
    The provider attribute in the StudyConfiguration class is the SQLAlchemy relationship that enables this.
