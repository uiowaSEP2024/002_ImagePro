# Create a Page

- Open the terminal and assuming your current directory is `/frontend`, navigate to the directory `/pages` using `cd src/pages`.
- Pages are mapped according to the filename. For example, `pages/about.js` is mapped to the `/about` route.
- The `index.ts` file is the first route that is rendered when the application is loaded.
- Read `tutorial-frontend/local-development` to start the application and view the `http://localhost:3000/`.
- Edit the file `index.js` and then view the changes on the browser on the same route mentioned above.
