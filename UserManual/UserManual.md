# User Manual

## Getting started:
The system contains contain the following technology stack:
1. NextJS/ReactJS for the frontend, with JEST testing.
2. FastAPI for backend, wiht pytest testing.
3. Postgres RDS(Cloud Hosted Database).

This User manual will assist you to build the application from the ground up with the aformentioned technology stack and testing criteria. The frontend and backend is considered as two seperate projects and the former communicates with the latter through http requests(GET, POST). We start with setting up the backend project by creating a backend folder in the /ROOT. Since we will be installing a ton of python packages as we go along, we need a virtual environment to run our backend system in. 

To setup a virtual environment, follow the README.md file in the backend folder, in the Getting Started Section.
