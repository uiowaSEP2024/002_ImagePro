# trackerapi
TrackerAPI is a wrapper library around the HTTP endpoints for the `backend` service.


# Example
For an example of how TrackerAPI can be used, see and example job script in `demo/mockscript.py`.

In the `mockscript.py` example, it communicates with a locally running `backend`. 
> See the [`backend` README](https://github.com/sep-23/team_03/tree/main/backend#readme) for how to set up and start your backend locally.

To run this example, from the `trackerapi` directory, run the following command in your terminal
```bash
python -m demo.mockscript
```
