# Image Processing Backend Project

## Overview

This project is developed as part of ECE:5830 Software Engineering Project in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Iowa.

- **Group ID:** 002_ImagePro
- **Project Title:** Image Processing Backend

## Project Description

The **Image Processing Backend** project is a collaborative effort aimed at developing an enterprise-level software solution for a medical imaging company. This project addresses the complex needs of the healthcare industry by providing a comprehensive system that includes the following key features:

- **AWS Hosted System:** We have created a robust and scalable system hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), ensuring high availability and reliability.

- **Order Processing:** Our software enables the efficient processing of orders, streamlining the workflow for the medical imaging company.

- **Compute Node Management:** We've implemented a compute node management system that hosts the company's products, allowing for efficient computation and data processing.

- **Automated Records Organization:** The system automates the organization of medical records, making data retrieval and management more efficient.

- **Billing Integration:** We've integrated a billing system that automates invoicing and payment processing, reducing administrative overhead.

- **Front-End Visualization:** Our software offers a user-friendly front-end interface, providing access to crucial metrics and visualization tools for easy data interpretation.

- **Data Security:** We prioritize data security and have implemented measures to ensure compliance with Patient Health Information (PHI) standards, safeguarding sensitive patient data.

This project represents a significant step forward in the field of medical imaging, providing an all-in-one solution that enhances efficiency, data security, and accessibility for healthcare professionals.
