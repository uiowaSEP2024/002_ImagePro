    JobConfiguration model

    A JobConfiguration represents a specific configuration for a job. It is created by a provider and

    of provider_id, tag, and version.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    id : int
        Auto-generated internal job configuration id
    tag : str
        Internal tag used to link a job configuration
    name : str

    provider_id : int
        ForeignKey to User id of the provider
    version : str
        Version of the job configuration
    # TODO Figure out exactly what a relationship means in this context and add a description
    provider : relationship

    step_configurations : relationship
        Relationship to the StepConfiguration model. Represents all step configurations associated with this job configuration
